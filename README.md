# MightyGau-8Avenger
Modification for the game 'ArmA 3'. Basically the mod changes the 20 mm gun of the A-164 “Wipeout” to a more powerful version, the well-known GAU-8/A Avenger 30 mm gun of the A-10 aircraft. So in future you will be able to use the gun as it is supposed to: as a tank buster and for scaring the shit out of your enemy.

The available documentation can be found in [our wiki](https://github.com/ZabuzaW/MightyGau-8Avenger/wiki).
