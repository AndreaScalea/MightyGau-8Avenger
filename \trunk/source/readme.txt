To get our support for modded vehicles working you need to copy the desired files from '/additional addon support' to '/addons'.
ArmA will only load files from the '/addons' folder. If you add our support files but don't have the mod you will get error messages.

> Contact us at the Bistudio Forum

- A vehicle, that is supported from us, does not work with our mod?
