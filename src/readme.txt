To get our support for modded vehicles working you need to copy the desired files from '/additional addon support' to '/addons'.
ArmA will only load files from the '/addons' folder. If you add our support files but don't have the mod you will get error messages.

**** Optional Modules ****
- Less FX, more performance (decreases the amount of particle effects and their lifetime which increases the performance)

The files from our '/optional' directory are optional modules that you can use if you wish.
Just copy the modules you would like to use to '/addons' as ArmA will only load files from the '/addons' folder.

**** Problems? ****
Check if you got the newest version (refer to versions.txt)

- A vehicle, other than supported, has no ammunition (empty magazine)?
> The vehicle probably adds our weapon (or the default A-164 weapon) but not the magazine
> Contact us at the Bistudio Forum

- A vehicle, that is supported from us, does not work with our mod?
> Check if you 'installed' our support correctly (refer to section 'Supported Mods').
> Still not working? Contact us at the Bistudio Forum

- You are facing performance issues with our mod?
> Try our 'Less FX, more performance' module (refer to section 'Optional Modules').
